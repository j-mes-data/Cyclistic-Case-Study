-- After uploading datasets to BigQuery via Google Cloud bucket, I created 4 new tables for each Quarter of the year. 
This allowed me to more easily analyze the datasets, as well as do it on a seasonal basis. 
I also added 2 new columns to these tables: duration_minutes and day_of_week

CREATE TABLE big-query-practice-413618.Cyclistic_data.Q1_24_trips_w_duration AS
SELECT
 *,
 TIMESTAMP_DIFF(ended_at, started_at, MINUTE) AS duration_minutes,
